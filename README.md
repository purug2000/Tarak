TARAK

In this era of modern technology that we are living in today, does not permit one to invest much of his time into knowing the world around them .Picking up the example of natural disasters ,a middle class man who wastes approximately much of his day to day life earning money for the welfare of his family ,might be completly unaware that there is a high probablity of a natural disaster in the very area that he daily visits. Everybody reads newspapers to gain info about the weather today or otherwise may come to know through the TV that there might be a proximity of an earthquake, volcanic eruption, cyclone, heavy rainfall.,etc. But what if we could get all this info daily ,even before someone steps out of his/her shelter. Well keeping this idea in mind ,here is the solution TARAK, a web app (to be developed by priyanshu@cse.iitk.ac.in ,karanv@iitk.ac.in and triptesh@iitk.ac.in)
